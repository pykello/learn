## Group Theory  
A **group** is a set $G$ equipped with a binary operation on $G$ (let’s call it “ $\ast$ ”) that satisfies:
1. Associativity: $a\ast(b\ast c) = (a\ast b)\ast c$ for all $a,b,c\in G$
2. Identity element $e$ exists. $e\ast a = a\ast e = a$ for all $a\in G$
3. Every element has an inverse: $\forall a\in G, \exists a^{-1}$ s.t. $a\ast a^{-1}=a^{-1}\ast a = e$

If in addition $a\ast b = b\ast a$ for all $a,b$ in $G$, the group is **abelian (commutative)​**.

Classic examples of groups include:
* The integers under addition $(\mathbb{Z},+)$
* The nonzero rationals under multiplication $(\mathbb{Q}^\times,\cdot)$
* The symmetric group $S_n$ of permutations on $n$ letters (non-abelian for $n\ge 3$)
* The group of $n\times n$ invertible matrices $GL_n(F)$ over a field $F$ under matrix multiplication​

Groups can be finite or infinite, abelian or non-abelian, but all share the above axioms.

### Key Theorems and Concepts

**Lagrange’s Theorem**: if $H$ is a subgroup of a finite group $G$, then the order (size) of $H$
divides the order of $G$​.

As a consequence, order of any element $a$ of a finite group (i.e. the smallest $k$ such that $a^k=e$)
divides the order of that group. This can be used to prove **Fermat’s Little Theorem**.

**Fermat's Little Theorem.** Let $p$ be a prime number, and $a$ an integer such that $p \nmid a$. Then:

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
$$

**Proof.** Let $G = (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$  be the multiplicative group of integers modulo $p$.
Since $p$ is prime, this group contains $1, 2, \ldots, p-1$. So, $|G| = p - 1$. Since order of every element
divides $p - 1$, for every $a \in G$ we have:

$$
a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}
$$

**Cauchy’s Theorem.** For a prime $p$ dividing $|G|$, there exists an element of order $p$.

**Class Equation.** The class equation of a finite group $G$ expresses its order as a sum over conjugacy classes:

$$
|G| = |Z(G)| + \Sigma_i[G: C_G(g_i)]
$$

**Existence of Cyclic Subgroups.** For any element $g \in G$, the set $\langle g \rangle = {g^n | n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ forms a **cyclic subgroup of $G$, generated by $g$. This is the smallest subgroup containing $g$.

**Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups** states that any finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of cyclic groups of prime-power order​.  This classification is helpful in understanding the structure of abelian groups.

Another important notion is a **group homomorphism**, a structure-preserving map between groups. The **First Isomorphism Theorem** tells us that if $f: G \to G'$ is a homomorphism, then $\text{im} f \cong G/\ker f$. That is, the image of $f$ is isomorphic to the quitent group $G / \ker f$.

### Problem Solving Strategies
* *Use Lagrange’s Theorem*: If a problem involves a finite group of known order, consider the possible orders of subgroups or elements. For example, if $|G|$ is prime, $G$ must be cyclic of that prime order. If an equation like $a^k = e$ is given, the order of $a$ divides $k$. This can restrict possibilities and simplify the problem.
* *Consider extreme or special elements*: The identity $e$ and inverses are often crucial. If an equation or condition is given for all group elements, try plugging in $a=e$ or $b=a^{-1}$ or such to glean information. For instance, if given a functional equation on $G$, substituting identity elements can simplify it.
* *Look for invariants or actions*: To count or classify objects up to symmetry, consider group actions. Tools like the orbit-stabilizer theorem and Burnside’s Lemma help solve problems like counting cube colorings under rotation. This strategy, common in combinatorics, often involves symmetry groups.
* *Direct algebraic manipulation*: Don’t forget to apply the basic axioms.
* *Try small cases or constructing subgroups*: If a problem states a general claim, test it on small groups (like $\mathbb{Z}_n$ or $S_3$) to see what’s going on. Sometimes understanding the claim for simple examples gives insight into the general proof. If the problem asserts something must equal the identity, attempt to show it by considering the element’s powers or the subgroup it generates.

(The elements of $G$ in the sequence are not required to be distinct. A *subsequence* of a sequence is obtained by selecting some of the terms, not necessarily consecutive, without reordering them; for example, $4, 4, 2$ is a subsequence of $2, 4, 6, 4, 2$, but $2, 2, 4$ is not.)
